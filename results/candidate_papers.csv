Which side are you on? Insider-Outsider classification in conspiracy-theoretic social media,"[Name(first='Pavan', last='Holur'), Name(first='Tianyi', last='Wang'), Name(first='Shadi', last='Shahsavari'), Name(first='Timothy', last='Tangherlini'), Name(first='Vwani', last='Roychowdhury')]",10.18653/v1/2022.acl-long.341,"Social media is a breeding ground for threat narratives and related conspiracy theories. In these, an outside group threatens the integrity of an inside group, leading to the emergence of sharply defined group identities: Insiders – agents with whom the authors identify and Outsiders – agents who threaten the insiders. Inferring the members of these groups constitutes a challenging new NLP task: (i) Information is distributed over many poorly-constructed posts; (ii) Threats and threat agents are highly contextual, with the same post potentially having multiple agents assigned to membership in either group; (iii) An agent’s identity is often implicit and transitive; and (iv) Phrases used to imply Outsider status often do not follow common negative sentiment patterns. To address these challenges, we define a novel Insider-Outsider classification task. Because we are not aware of any appropriate existing datasets or attendant models, we introduce a labeled dataset (CT5K) and design a model (NP2IO) to address this task. NP2IO leverages pretrained language modeling to classify Insiders and Outsiders. NP2IO is shown to be robust, generalizing to noun phrases not seen during training, and exceeding the performance of non-trivial baseline models by 20%.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.341.pdf,2022,acl_anthology,No,No,Yes,Conspiracy Theories,Yes,Social media is a breeding ground for threat narratives and related conspiracy theories.,Yes,Insider-Outsider classification,Yes,pretrained language modeling,Yes,conspiracy-theoretic social media,No,,False
Conspiracy Narratives in the Protest Movement Against COVID-19 Restrictions in Germany. A Long-term Content Analysis of Telegram Chat Groups.,"[Name(first='Manuel', last='Weigand'), Name(first='Maximilian', last='Weber'), Name(first='Johannes', last='Gruber')]",10.18653/v1/2022.nlpcss-1.8,"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, different groups have been protesting measures implemented by different government bodies in Germany to control the pandemic. It was widely claimed that many of the offline and online protests were driven by conspiracy narratives disseminated through groups and channels on the messenger app Telegram. We investigate this claim by measuring the frequency of conspiracy narratives in messages from open Telegram chat groups of the Querdenken movement, set up to organize protests against COVID-19 restrictions in Germany. We furthermore explore the content of these messages using topic modelling. To this end, we collected 822k text messages sent between April 2020 and May 2022 in 34 chat groups. By fine-tuning a Distilbert model, using self-annotated data, we find that 8.24% of the sent messages contain signs of conspiracy narratives. This number is not static, however, as the share of conspiracy messages grew while the overall number of messages shows a downward trend since its peak at the end of 2020. We further find a mix of known conspiracy narratives make up the topics in our topic model. Our findings suggest that the Querdenken movement is getting smaller over time, but its remaining members focus even more on conspiracy narratives.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.nlpcss-1.8.pdf,2022,acl_anthology,No,No,Yes,Conspiracy Theories,Yes,"We investigate this claim by measuring the frequency of conspiracy narratives in messages from open Telegram chat groups of the Querdenken movement, set up to organize protests against COVID-19 restrictions in Germany.",Yes,"Narrative Classification,

Identifying Conspiracy Theories News based on Event Relation Graph,"[Name(first='Yuanyuan', last='Lei'), Name(first='Ruihong', last='Huang')]",10.18653/v1/2023.findings-emnlp.656,"Conspiracy theories, as a type of misinformation, are narratives that explains an event or situation in an irrational or malicious manner. While most previous work examined conspiracy theory in social media short texts, limited attention was put on such misinformation in long news documents. In this paper, we aim to identify whether a news article contains conspiracy theories. We observe that a conspiracy story can be made up by mixing uncorrelated events together, or by presenting an unusual distribution of relations between events. Achieving a contextualized understanding of events in a story is essential for detecting conspiracy theories. Thus, we propose to incorporate an event relation graph for each article, in which events are nodes, and four common types of event relations, coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent relations, are considered as edges. Then, we integrate the event relation graph into conspiracy theory identification in two ways: an event-aware language model is developed to augment the basic language model with the knowledge of events and event relations via soft labels; further, a heterogeneous graph attention network is designed to derive a graph embedding based on hard labels. Experiments on a large benchmark dataset show that our approach based on event relation graph improves both precision and recall of conspiracy theory identification, and generalizes well for new unseen media sources.",https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.656.pdf,2023,acl_anthology,No,No,Yes,Conspiracy Theories,Yes,"Conspiracy theories, as a type of misinformation, are narratives that explains an event or situation in an irrational or malicious manner.",Yes,Conspiracy Theory Identification,Yes,"Graph-based Analysis,
